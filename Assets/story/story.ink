- Our story begins in the middle of space. A spaceship is floating, surrounded by stars. Suddenly, the spaceship hits something. CRASH!

* Ahh!

- The spaceship shakes and loses power. Lights go off, and everything goes dark.

- The main character slowly opens their eyes. They feel dizzy. They look around and see the broken spaceship.

* Oh no... my spaceship.

- The spaceship is damaged everywhere. Pieces are broken, wires are hanging, and smoke is rising.

* How am I going to get home now?

- The main character feels alone and sad, staring at the broken spaceship.

- The main character is still staring at the broken spaceship. They are so focused on it that they don’t notice a strange figure coming closer.

- The alien quietly walks up and reaches out a hand. Then, it taps the main character’s shoulder.

===run===

- !@$%^&*?

- The main character jumps in fear! Their heart races as they turn and see the alien.

- Without thinking, the main character runs as fast as they can, trying to get away. The alien watches, surprised.

- Night begins to fall on the strange planet. The sky grows darker, and the main character starts to feel cold and alone.

* I have nowhere else to go... I need to go back to my spaceship...

* I have nowhere else to go... I can build my tent and sleep there

===inspaceship===
- The next morning, the main character wakes up inside the cold, dark spaceship. They sit up and look around at the broken controls and scattered wires.

* Let’s see what I need to fix.
    -> fix1
* Let's see what those Alien does.
- They look kind of frightening… but they don’t seem like they want to hurt me.
* Maybe I could make some ramen and share it with the aliens… Maybe they’d like to try it!
- The main character heads back into the spaceship, grabs a pack of ramen, and sets up a small portable stove. The smell of noodles and spices fills the air, drifting out to where the aliens are watching.
- The aliens sniff the air and slowly come closer, curious about the strange smell.
* Hey… would you like to try some?
- One alien cautiously steps forward and takes the bowl, looking at it with wide eyes. The main character shows them how to eat it, and soon they’re all slurping noodles together.
- After sharing ramen with the aliens, the main character has another idea. They reach into the spaceship and pull out a small music player.
* I wonder… would they like music too?
- The main character turns on the music, starting with a soft, cheerful melody. The sound fills the air, and the aliens perk up, their eyes widening as they listen.
- Some of the aliens sway back and forth, while others tap their feet or clap along, trying to understand the rhythm.
* Looks like they like it!
- Soon, the main character and the aliens are moving to the beat together, sharing laughter and smiles.
- After a night of ramen and music, the main character thinks about how much easier things would be if they could actually talk to the aliens.
* Maybe I could build a translator… It would help us understand each other better.
